/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding is when the "this" keyword is not bound to any particular object and is operating on the window scope, which is not recommended.
* 2. Implicit Binding is when the "this" keyword is bound to object that is using a function. The "this" is the argument passed into the function.
* 3. New Binding is when a new object is being created by a Constructor function. The "New" keyword is referring to the new object keys.
* 4. Explicit Binding is when a function is being called, but the argument is overridden by the this keyword, which is passed through the parameter.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
